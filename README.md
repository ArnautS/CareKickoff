# The CareConnections Kickoff Assignment

Welcome to the CareConnections Kickoff. What does this mean?
 
In the Data folder of this repository you will find JSON files with client data. These are obviously fake clients with fake data. The basic premise if what we would like you to do, is **create an application that displays this data**.

There is a lot of freedom in this exercise, where you can choose which parts of the application you find most important. What do you want the application to look like? Do you include security issues, and if so how? Will you deal with authorization of who is actually allowed to access the client files? It's all up to you.

The data includes several fake employee accounts with a list of which clients they are authorized to access their data. Clients each have careplans, reports, as well as general information to be displayed. Whichever parts of these data you end up choosing to utilize is your own choice.

Use whatever technologies you want to show off. At CareConnections we use C# and MSSql on the Azure platform. We create our mobile applications with Xamarin, the APIs with SignalR and .NET Core. But do you prefer creating a web application, or native apps with Flutter and a Python-based API, or even a WebAssembly web application? Go for it. We believe good developers can adapt to whatever technology they are interested in.

We are not expecting you to create a fully-fledged Electronic Client File application, so choose wisely which parts of such a solution you want to focus on. Create what you feel shows off your programming skills best, and then send in a Pull Request. You will then be invited for an interview with two Developers in which you can discuss your choices with them.

Good luck, and most importantly, have fun!
